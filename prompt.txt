I want to discuss with you with something about my website,basically i have already my website ready which is ewu course fetching which uses external api to fetch everything through my website php api code.now the website is in free mode and fresh load free,thats why there is no error now.but on the course time the server gets jammed as too many students try to access the website at the same time.so i iwant to add a special feature where the website will keep trying the portal until it gets response.increase timeout time.and it should show small status bar on top right corner,how many attemps have been made and what is the status.so after getting response and succesfull login it will then try to fetch dept and semester option,again here it will keep trying automatically until it gets desired output and here also small window of attempt count.now next when user clicks fetcg course after this step,it will again try to fetch course until it gtes desired output,also here also a small attempt window. 
the whole attempt feature will be auto and infinite time.for every attemp it will try for 60 sec and go to next attempt.for this it will depend on the api response

So tell me how can i do that
